# Project-Raven
 Project Raven is a project for the creation of a simple, multi-use, Thought Core.

 What is a Thought Core?
 It's my name for a base system that a machine uses for solving problems.
 A Thought Core's base is a Neural Network, 
 although for the actual solving of most problems a Thought Core will utilize multiple algorithms.

 A Though Core is based off two principles found in nature: 
 1). That Uniqueness helps the creation of new solutions
 2). That Uniformity is required for survival.

 Each Thought Core is given a unique ID number, and a unique random seed number.
